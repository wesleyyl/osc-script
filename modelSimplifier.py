#first start by adding all the tellurium stuff around it!
#a way to reduce rate constant values (round k to smaller and smaller values)
#commenting out one line at a time to see if it still remains an oscillator
#look for autocatalytic reactions!!
#remove variables that don't affect reaction
	#can do this by commenting out every line with a certain variable and seeing if it still oscillates
